\description{
Synchronizes DESCRIPTION and renv.lock to match packages used in code.
Code is treated as the source of truth. Adds missing packages and
removes unused packages.
}
\details{
This function treats code as the single source of truth:
\itemize{
\item Packages used in code but not in DESCRIPTION → added to DESCRIPTION
\item Packages in DESCRIPTION but not in code → removed from DESCRIPTION
\item Packages used in code but not in renv.lock → added to renv.lock
\item Packages in renv.lock but not in code → removed from renv.lock
}

The "renv" package is always protected and never removed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Sync packages (code is source of truth)
sync_packages()

# Preview changes without applying
sync_packages(dry_run = TRUE)

# Sync with verbose output
sync_packages(verbose = TRUE)
}

}
